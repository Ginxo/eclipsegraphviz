This project is home to a .settings directory that is shared 
(through linked resources) by other projects in this repository.
Thus, all settings configured for this project are automatically
picked up by the other projects. 

In order for the linking to work, you must define a workspace path
variable named WORKSPACE_ROOT and point it to your workspace root
directory. You do that by going to Window > Preferences… > General > 
Workspace > Linked resources and pressing the "New..." button.
